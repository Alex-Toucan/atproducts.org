Python Basics

Comments
You can write text that the program will ignore by beginning the line with a #, this helps with reminding you what certain code does or for explaining purposes.


py

Data types
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:


Text Type: str

Numeric Types: int, float, complex

Sequence Types: list, tuple, range

Mapping Type: dict

Set Types: set, frozenset

Boolean Type: bool

Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview


We will go more in-depth on some of these types in the next few paragraphs.

You can print the data type of a variable with the type() function:

py

x = 5

print(type(x))


Strings
Strings are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.


py

x = "hello"

y = 'hello'


# single quotations and double quotation marks are the same


x == y # returns True


You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:


py

x = """The FitnessGram Pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter Pacer test will begin in 30 seconds."""


You can check the length of a string using the len() function:


py

x = "hello"

print(len(text)) # returns 5


Numbers
There are 2 primary, int and float


py

x = 2 # int

y = 2.8 # float


To verify the type of an object in Python, use the type() function:


py

print(type(x))

print(type(y))


Int, or integers, are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.

Float is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.


Both strings and numbers are built-in data types
