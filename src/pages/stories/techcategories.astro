          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informational technology; people receive as good and bad. Can technology be good? Of course, in many different ways. Informational technology has many categories that people use for daily activities. People use informational technology for communication, medicine, transportation, safety, and more that people use daily, or for other purposes. Modern advancements in technology have significantly improved our lives. With each innovation, there are increasing opportunities for people to benefit from these categories. From communication to medical care, technology continues to offer more advantages than ever before.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with communication devices, which started in the 1980s. Devices such as phones/tablets, laptops/desktops, and televisions, help us communicate with each other, even if we are so far away, and can help connect friends and family, or a company to a client, or do project collaboration for example. Communication devices are more popular in younger generations, but 60.42% of the world has at least one smartphone, which applies to all generations. Schools are implementing ICTs (communication technologies), as researchers stated: “our study extends the debate on subjects, academic content, and classroom knowledge by addressing the role that ICTs may play in transforming academic content into classroom knowledge, as an added feature that may qualify the transformation process” <a href="#source-1" class="fw-bold">[1]</a>. Not only schools use ICTs, but some Government organizations post stuff on social media for the general public, which helps raise awareness on the topic they are posting on, which can be done by national, state, county, city, and even regional governments, and much more. As communication devices rise in popularity, more people will use them, even in areas where they were never expected as a society.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit more personal types of devices, medical devices, such as portable medical measurement systems, and alert devices (ex: beepers). The most popular device for medical device, the beeper device saves lives by helping raise awareness of a fallen or hurt civilian (typically senior). They (and smartwatches) may also call 911 automatically, saving the effort of civilians or others of manually calling them. Medical measurement systems, as medical devices can measure certain things in our bodies, such as blood pressure, or blood sugar, in our own homes and can be very portable, which is only ever so expanding in today’s world as an industry. Some other medical devices can measure pills for example for a certain dosage, and beepers can either beep in case of a fallen citizen (typically seniors) to make others aware, or they can call 911 on themselves. These medical devices are more used towards vulnerable people, such as seniors. Medical devices save lives every day, and will only save more as innovations come out and they get more popular.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about a category that most of us have to use every day? Transportation has been taking an independent turn since the 2010s. People in the early 1900s only thought about these innovations, but there are now self-driving cars, which people can own, or take as a taxi. There are also apps on smartphones to order a driver, similar to a taxi but can go much longer distances instead of having a strict zone within borders. Now not everyone uses these innovations, but a lot of people do, typically in cities or larger populated areas, and will continue to increase customers as the new era continues.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these technology categories can do good, such as improving how people live and interact with others or themselves. Whether it is how people communicate with each other, saving people’s lives, or the way people get around. The way technology has increased convenience and accessibility, only in the past few decades, highlights the positive aspects of people’s lives using them. It will only expand as more innovations come out, and they get popular.</p>
