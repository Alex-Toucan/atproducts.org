HTML Basics
Example document:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<body>

<h1>My first Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph</p>

</body>

</html>



The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.


HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:


<h1>Big</h1>

<h6>Small</h6>



HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:


<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<p>This is another paragraph.</p>



HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

<a href="https://example.com">This is a link</a>



HTML Images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:


<img src="example.jpg" alt="example.com" width="104" height="142">
