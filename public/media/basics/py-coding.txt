Python Basics

Strings
Strings are surrounded by either single quotation marks or double quotation marks.


py

x = "hello"

y = 'hello'


x == y # single quotations and double quotation marks are the same


You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:


py

x = """The FitnessGram Pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter Pacer test will begin in 30 seconds."""


You can check the length of a string using the len() function:


py

x = "hello"

print(len(text)) # returns 5


Numbers
There are 2 primary , int and float.


py

x = 2 # int

y = 2.8 # float


To verify the type of an object in Python, use the type() function:


py

print(type(x))

print(type(y))


Int, or integers, are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.

Float is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

Both strings and numbers are built-in data types.
