We gotta first lay down the very first thing to know. The <!DOCTYPE html> tag represents the Document Type and helps some browsers display correctly with your website, must only be used once. Some elements do need closing tag, like </center>.


The <head> tag is needed to represent the head of the website. The <body> tag is the same thing, but it's the body.


HTML Basic Text
Some elements are meant to show text like <text>, and <p>.


<p> This is text <p>


HTML Headings
The <h> tag has 6 different sizes, from <h1> to <h6>.

1 is the hugest, to 6 is the smallest.


<h1> This is a heading </h1>


HTML Links
The <a> is a text element to represent links. Once clicked on the hyperlink, will redirect the user to a new link.
