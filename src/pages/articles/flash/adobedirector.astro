          <div id="what">
            <h2> What is Adobe Director </h2>
            <p> Adobe Director (codenamed Apollo) runtime enables developers to use HTML, JavaScript, Adobe Flash software, and ActionScript to build web applications that run as standalone client applications without the constraints of a browser. This supports AIR files for installation. <a href="adobeairlogohistory">Adobe Director's logo history</a> falls under <a href="adobeflashlogohistory">Adobe's Flash Player logo history</a>, having similar logos. Adobe Director was discontinued at the same time that Flash Player was discontinued, on January 1st, 2021.</p> 
          </div>
          <div id="plugins">
            <h2>Plug-ins</h2> 
            <p> One of the few differences between Director and Flash is that Director supports plug-ins or Xtras. This is possible by a tool named Adobe Director's XDK (Xtra Development Kit), which is a C++ SDK. With each new version, new changes are important for these plug-ins.  </p>
          </div>
          <div id="download">
            <h2> How to use Adobe Director past 2017 </h2>
            <p> Adobe Director has standalone apps that have DCR files pre-loaded (<a href="/media/files/spongebob-example.zip" download>example</a>).</p>
            <p> You can download the most recent version of <a href="/media/files/Projector Skeleton for Adobe Director 12.0.1.122.zip" download>Projector Skeleton for Adobe Director here</a> for using DCR files onto a Windows app. It will ask you once you open the application, to put in a DCR file. Make sure that the plugin is in the same folder (directory) as the DCR file. You can download a <a href="/media/files/anchovies.dcr">example DCR game here</a>.</p>
            <p> If you have issues about 16-bit apps with Director, you may <a href="https://github.com/otya128/winevdm#readme">view how to run them on Windows 10 or above</a>.</p>
