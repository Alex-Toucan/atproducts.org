AH Situation - Comment and response

"I feel like I have to respond to this situation, so everyone can get my side of on how I feel and how the situation went down in my words. Let's get the basic things out, I basically feel betrayed by oth Anayla and Alyssa, since I thought she was a mutual-acquaintance to me. But according to a 6th sixer names Jackson, on her snapchat "hates me". According to some messages. The thing I'm extremely passed off about is that Anayla spread around the email basically admitted that I did like her. So I'll update this text file once updates come up to this situation."
