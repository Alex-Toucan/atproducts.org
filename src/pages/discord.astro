<h3> I: Discord ToS </h3>
 <p>
  This section is reserved to the <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord ToS</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Discord Community Guidelines</a>, what this paragraph is referring to is the coding/hacking side of the two Discord Documents, please read the two webpages for full Discord Guidelines. The following rules will be enforced: It's required to be 13 and over due to the US law. And also any partially illegal activity will be taken seriously. You may also not commit non-ethical hacking (meaning illegal hacking), which means commiting the acts like, phishing, DDOS, token theft, distribute malware, and other <b> non-ethical </b> hacking techniques, which is why the content like that is <b> website-exclusive</b> to us. Also related to coding/ethical hacking, do not distribute or provide access to content that involves hacking, cracking, distribution of stolen goods, pirated content, or accounts. Any full or partial violation of the <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord ToS</a> and the <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Discord Community Guidelines</a> will be a instant ban on all of our Discord Servers.

<h3> II: Our Discord Server Rules </h3>
   <p> This whole section is reserved to our rules to use our Discord servers. Minor violations will be in a mute/warning. Major violations will be in a kick/ban. 
<br> <br>
 We take the Discord TOS seriously and any minor or major violation will result in a permanent ban from any AT Products servers, but not services.
<br> <br>
    Some of the Discord Servers that take part of AT Products's Family of Services and Products may have different rules that take place in their community. So let alone our Discord Rules document, and the extra rules We may have, will be taken in place as the rules to be in our Discord Communities and Servers.
<br> <br>
    Please have respect for our members. Meaning that bullying, being toxic, causing drama, and other acts to intentionally mentally, and/or emotionally harm our members, is completely prohibited, and will be taken seriously.
<br> <br>
    If homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist (or feminism), or any other phobic, will not tolerated, and will receive disciplinary action. If already known to have any phobics, will be banned before hand. If you fail to comply to our rules, you will be banned.
<br> <br>
    Raiding will be taken seriously since it violates Discord TOS (also in exploits), and your whole server/anyone involved will be permanently banned from any AT Products servers and services.
<br> <br>
    Evading a ban may result in a IP termination and will never get to appeal. Any alternative accounts is prohibited if you are banned.
<br> <br>
    NSFW does matter in some servers. If there isn’t a NSFW channel, don’t post any NSFW at all. If there is a NSFW channel or more, post NSFW there. NSFW could apply to pornography only, as gore, child porn, and bestiality is completely prohibited as it is against the US law. 18 is the age of consent in the US and will apply to any AT Products services, no matter what country you’re in and what the age of consent there (because it’s younger and we don’t want to promote that).
<br> <br>
    If you’re known as something that’s unlawful, such as bestiality, or a pedophile, will be banned or will even be banned before-hand if it does spread around.
<br> <br>
    Any hackers that threaten AT Products or it’s affiliates will be banned from all servers and services. If already known as a hacker, will be banned before-hand for our safety. </p>
